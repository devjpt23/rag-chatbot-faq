# How Matrix Works in the Calculator [Verified Content]

## Basic Matrix Operations
The calculator provides comprehensive matrix functionality through the MATRIX Mode, which can be accessed by pressing `N6(MATRIX)`. Here's how the matrix system works:

### Matrix Storage and Variables
- Matrices can be stored in variables MatA, MatB, and MatC
- Access these variables by pressing `14(MATRIX)` followed by:
  - `3(MatA)` for MatA
  - `4(MatB)` for MatB
  - `5(MatC)` for MatC

### Matrix Input and Editing
1. Enter MATRIX Mode: Press `N6(MATRIX)`
2. Select matrix (e.g., MatA) and specify dimensions (e.g., 2×2)
3. Use Matrix Editor to input elements
4. Input values followed by `=` for each element

### Supported Operations
The calculator supports various matrix operations:
- Matrix multiplication (×)
- Matrix addition (+)
- Matrix subtraction (-)
- Scalar multiplication (e.g., 3 × MatA)
- Determinant calculation (det) using `14(MATRIX) 7(det)`
- Matrix transposition (Trn) using `14(MATRIX) 8(Trn)`
- Inverse matrix calculation (using E for -1)
- Absolute value of elements (using `1w(Abs)`)
- Matrix powers (square using w, cube using `1w(x3)`)

### Matrix Answer Memory
- Results are displayed in MatAns screen
- Results are automatically stored in "MatAns" variable
- Access MatAns using: `14(MATRIX) 6(MatAns)`
- Compatible with operators: +, -, *, /, E, w
- MatAns screen automatically switches to calculation screen when using operators

### Limitations and Restrictions
The Matrix Editor does not support:
- m, 1m(M–), 1t(STO) operations
- Pol, Rec functions
- Multi-statements
- Cannot use 6 for inputting powers (use w instead)

### Additional Features
- Matrix copying functionality available
- Direct element editing through Matrix Editor
- Dimension modification capabilities
- Comprehensive calculation examples provided in manual
